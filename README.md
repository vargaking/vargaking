### Hi there, I'm Dani!
 ⚡ I'm currently studying in Hungary, at the Fazekas Mihaly High School. I love IT and IT loves me too (I hope at least). In the past I tried to get acquainted with web development so now I can handle some technologies like
 - React (+Native) and Electron
 - Node.js, Express.js and Django
 - MongoDB, Firebase Realtime-DB and a little bit of SQL
 
 Some other tech I'm familiar with:

🐧 Btw I use Arch. In my free time I like configuring my system (and then reinstalling it), but I am improving day to day and I really like it. Wanna learn some scripting during the summer so I can make much more stuff with Linux.

🤖 Also I used to program robotzzz and arduinos in the past and I learned using micropython and some C++ libraries during robotics competitions. 

😄 Discord is a pretty good platform and I like making it better (for me at least). I made some spambot, adminbot and others, whose are sadly hungarian bots, but I am working on making them open source and multilingual so more people can use them. In the past I learned some Blender to make some CG, you can check out my work on my Instagram profile.

🔭 I am currently working on an open-source project called Project Axolotl, which is a very cool blockchain based, decentralized messaging app, you should check it out or better, support the development by your knowledge or by testing our product.
