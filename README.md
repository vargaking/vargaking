### Hi there, I'm Dani!
 ⚡ I'm currently studying **Computer Science and Engineering**, at **Eindhoven University of Technology**. I love IT and IT loves me too (I hope at least). In the past I tried to get acquainted with web development so now I can handle some technologies like
 - React (+Native), Svelte (+SvelteKit) and Electron
 - Node.js, Express.js and Django
 - MongoDB and SQL
 
 Some other tech I'm familiar with:

🐧 Btw I use Arch. In my free time I like configuring my system (and then reinstalling it), but I am improving day to day and I really like it.

🤖 As part of my secondary school's robotic team Fazekas RoboTeam, I learned using micropython and some C++ libraries during robotics competitions and later was involved in coaching younger teams too.

😄 Discord is a pretty good platform and I like making it better (for me at least). I made some spambot, adminbot and others. In the past I learned some Blender to make some CG, you can check out my work on my Instagram profile.

🔭 I was researching decentralized data sending, as part of Project Axolotl, which was awarded cum laude in the Hungarian Youth Science and Innovation Competition.
